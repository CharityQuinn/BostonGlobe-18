# BostonGlobe-18

This *The Onion-18*, app will allow users to scrape articles from The Onion.  The user will also be able to **click** an article and then either leave a note or link to that article in the Onion.  This app uses Mongo, Express, and Javascript to accomplish this task.  Cheerio is used to interpret the data that is received from the scrape. 

I am very **impressed** with the learning I have acheived in this app.  Errors help with the learning - giving me a view into to the correct and incorrect ways of coding.  I have received support from TA's, Tutor, a fellow student and the instructor.  If you have any questions, please contact me through Gmail at CharityAQuinn@gmail.com.

I have include a few screen shots of the site below:
