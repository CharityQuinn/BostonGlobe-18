# BostonGlobe-18

This *Boston Globe-18*, :(The Onion): app will allow users to scrape articles from The Onion.  The user will also be able to **click** an article and leave a note or reaction to that article.  This app uses Mongo, Express, and Javascript to accomplish this task.  Cheerio is used to interpret the data that is received from the scrape.

I am very **impressed** with the learning I have acheived in this app.  Errors help with the learning - giving me a view into to the correct and incorrect ways of coding.  I have received support from both TA's, Tutor and the instructor.  If you have any questions, please contact me through Slack on the RUTSOM201811FSF4-FT channel under the name of Charity.

I have include a few screen shots of the site below:
